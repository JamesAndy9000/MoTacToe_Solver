# MoTacToe_Solver
A simple automated solver for a version of Tic-Tac-Toe that has 3 players instead of 2.

## Description
This is a personal project I started after getting intrigued by a game called Tic-Tac-Moe, which is like Tic-Tac-Toe, but on a 5x5 grid and having 3 players instead of 2. (Yes, I did misremember the name while making the project.) It is meant to generate a game tree and see if a player can force a victory- or at least a draw- from any position, just like someone would with regular Tic-Tac-Toe.
